# Heap

`Heap` class - binary max heap.

The solution consist of projects:
* _HeapLib_ - library containing `Heap` class,
* _HeapUnitTest_ - unit test for `Heap` class,
* _HeapApp_ - application that uses the `Heap` class.

## Task: Heap-insert

Implement `Heap` `insert` methods that insert the key value pair into the heap.

## Task: Heap-insert-complexity
Check the complexity of the insert into the heap operation - `insert` method:
* Measure the `insert` execution time for several heap sizes, for:
    * average case,
    * the worst case.
* Draw a graphs of the `insert` execution time versus the heap size,
* What is the nature of the drawn relationship (unknown, constant, linear, logarithmic, square)?
